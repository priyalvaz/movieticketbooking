Maja, a transplanted Romanian who, in the years since World War II has built a new life with her American husband, Lewis, keeping her darkest memories to herself. Those memories threaten to upend that life when, on the serene streets of her small town, she recognizes a former German soldier and sets in motion a series of drastic events to confront the trauma she believes he inflicted on her.
</p>
<p>
Enjoying a lackadaisical picnic with her young son, Patrick, Maja goes into high alert when a tall blond man walks by, and in short order she has followed him home to get a better look. Peeking into the tidy house he shares with his wife and two children, she sees his face clearly, and her reaction is visceral. She's shaken to the core.
