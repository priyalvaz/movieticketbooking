  Amrita Sabharwal and Vikram have been happily married for several years. Amrita is a sparkling woman and a homemaker, who is shown to spend her days looking after Vikram and the house. They throw a party at home to celebrate Vikram's promotion that would have them relocate to London. At the party however, Vikram gets a call informing him that his promotion contract has been compromised for his junior. Angered, he gets into an argument with his superior whom he accuses of two timing him. When Amrita tries to break up the argument, Vikram slaps her in front of everyone. The incident leaves her shaken; she starts to realize all the little unfair things that she had previously ignored and admits to herself that Vikram slapping her isn't what a husband who respects her would do. Moreover, Vikram refuses to take accountability for his actions, stating that he was upset, she got in the way, and things like that happen sometimes (which is wrong).
  </p>

  Unable to "forget it and move on", as everyone advises her to, Amrita leaves for her parentâ€™s home and stays there, leading to an argument between her and Vikram, as he thinks she's overreacting. He sends her a legal document to legally force her to return home. When she refuses, her lawyer explains to her that her options are to either reconcile, file for legal separation or get a divorce. She files for divorce, shocking her family and relatives, who also believe she should get over it. Amrita doesn't make any claims for alimony nor does she file a domestic violence charge; her stand is simply that Vikram has no right to hit her, not even once. She explains that she only asks for respect and happiness and the slap opened her eyes to the fact that she wasn't getting either. To make things more complicated, she discovers she is pregnant. Vikram and his lawyer play dirty when he finds out that she is pregnant. They make false claims against her mental stability, honesty and file frivolous charges against Amrita to try and intimidate her and get sole custody of the unborn child. Hurt, Amrita decides to file for the domestic violence charge against Vikram unless he agrees to a mutual consent divorce and joint custody of their expected child.

Throughout the movie, Amrita's journey is intertwined with that of two other women, her lawyer and her maid, who realize that they have been wronged by their husbands as well. Her actions help them find the strength to confront those problems and find solutions. The movie also shows snippets of the life of Amrita's neighbour who is a single working mother to a young girl who regularly practices dancing with Amrita.
